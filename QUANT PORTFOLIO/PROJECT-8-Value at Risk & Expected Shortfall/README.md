This project estimates **Value at Risk (VaR)** and **Expected Shortfall (ES)** for a synthetic return series.

## What's Included
- `data/returns.csv` – simulated daily returns
- `results/metrics.json` – calculated 95% and 99% VaR and ES
- `results/returns_distribution.png` – histogram of returns with VaR cutoffs
- `results/historical_var.png` – rolling 95% historical VaR
- `report.docx` – 2–3 page report with figures

## Key Numbers (Synthetic)
- VaR 95% = -0.0302, ES 95% = -0.0382
- VaR 99% = -0.0413, ES 99% = -0.0496

## Quickstart
1. Open the report to review methodology and results.
2. Replace simulated returns with real financial data for live testing.
3. Export report to PDF and push to GitHub.
